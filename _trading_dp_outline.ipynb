    "This quickly becomes infeasible as the horizon increases or the contract price becomes more volatile.\n",
    "We then introduce coverage ratio and coverage ratio change (v2), which greatly reduces the size of the DP table.\n",
    "However, coverage ratio can still explode for extreme cases, so we introduce coverage proportion (v3).\n",
    "Finally, we add market spreads to the model (v4).\n",

    "  Note that c and R are bounded between 0 and 1, and T is finite, but W and x can be arbitrarily large, so this problem formulation is infeasible\n",
